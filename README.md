# Practices

## Practice 1: TensorFlow 2 quickstart
Short introduction to Keras for development a multiclass classifier model(10 classes),
using basics preprocessing techniques getting 97% of accuracy .
* Load a prebuilt dataset.
* Build a neural network machine learning model that classifies images.
* Train this neural network.
* Evaluate the accuracy of the model.
